This GitHub repository showcases a detailed exploration of clustering techniques and the implementation of the elbow method for optimal cluster determination. The project is divided into two main points, each addressing specific aspects of clustering analysis.

- Point 1: Dice Distance and PAM Clustering
- Point 2: Elbow Method and K-Means Clustering
